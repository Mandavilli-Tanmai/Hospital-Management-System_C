# Hospital-Management-System_C

The current C program is a Hospital Slot Booking System designed to manage appointments for two doctors, Dr.ABC and Dr.DEF, with predefined time slots. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its functionality:

Key Features:
Manage Appointments for Two Doctors:

Each doctor has their own set of six appointment slots, corresponding to fixed 30-minute time intervals.

View Available Slots:

Displays available and booked slots separately for each doctor, showing which slots are free or already booked, along with the timing.

Book an Appointment:

The patient selects a doctor (either Dr.ABC or Dr.DEF) through a menu.

The program then displays the available slots for the selected doctor to make it easier for the patient to choose.

Once a slot is selected, the program collects patient details such as name, age, and disease and books the slot.

Cancel an Appointment:

The patient selects a doctor and provides the slot number to cancel an appointment.

Only valid cancellations are processed, ensuring that the selected slot was previously booked.

View Appointments:

Displays all booked appointments for each doctor, including patient details (name, age, and disease) and the appointment timings.

User-Friendly Menu:

The main menu provides options for viewing available slots, booking or canceling appointments, and viewing booked appointments for each doctor. Users can also exit the program.

Technical Details:
Predefined Slot Timings: Slots are fixed and shared by both doctors, with timings from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM in 30-minute intervals.

Doctor-Specific Slot Management: Each doctor has their own independent slot schedule, ensuring their appointments are managed separately.

Input Validation: Ensures valid inputs for slot selection and doctor choice.

Purpose:
This program is designed for small-scale hospital management, helping users efficiently handle appointments for two doctors while maintaining simplicity and clarity in operations.
